### Log Parser for Network Activity
File: `projects/log_parser.py`

A command-line tool for parsing network log files to extract IP addresses using regex, organizing logs by date, and listing directories with system commands. Key features:
- Regex Parsing: Extracts IPv4 addresses (`\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`) and dates (`\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`) using the `re` module.
- File Management: Uses `os` to scan directories, create date-based folders, and move logs.
- System Commands: Employs `subprocess` to list logs (e.g., `ls -l`).
- OOP Design: Implements classes with inheritance, properties, and error handling.
- Data Management: Tracks logs and IPs with lists and dictionaries.

Sample Logs: Test files in `projects/sample_logs/` (e.g., `server_2025-09-07.log`) simulate network activity with IPs.

Usage:
1. Place logs in `projects/sample_logs/` (format: `<name>_YYYY-MM-DD.log`).
2. Run `python projects/log_parser.py` and select:
   - 1: Parse logs for IPs and organize by date.
   - 2: List logs using system commands.
   - 3: View parsed entries.
   - 4: Exit.

This project showcases log analysis and automation skills for system admin/DevOps roles.
