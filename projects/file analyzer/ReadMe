# File Organizer & Log Analyzer

This Python script organizes files in the current directory by their extension, moving them into categorized folders (e.g., txt, jpg, pdf, video, etc.) inside a base directory called `files`. It also provides log file analysis and a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Features
- Organizes files by extension into folders (e.g., txt, jpg, pdf, video, other).
- Groups video files (mp4, mkv) into a single `video` folder.
- Avoids overwriting files by appending a counter to duplicate filenames.
- Analyzes `.log` files in the `files/log` folder for errors and timestamps.
- Displays organized file statistics and lists files.
- User-friendly menu interface for all operations.
- Does **not** delete any files.

## Usage
1. Place the script in the directory you want to organize.
2. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```
   python file_organizer_log_analyzer.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu to organize files, analyze logs, list files, or view file details.

## Menu Options
- **1: Organize Files** – Move files into categorized folders by extension.
- **2: Analyze Logs** – Scan `.log` files in the `files/log` folder for errors and timestamps.
- **3: List Files** – Show a directory listing of organized files.
- **4: View Files** – Display tracked files and their sizes.
- **5: Exit** – Quit the program.

## Notes
- The script only moves files; it does not delete or overwrite existing files.
- You can change the working directory by uncommenting and editing the `os.chdir()` line at the top of the script.
- Supported extensions include: txt, jpg, png, pdf, docx, xlsx, xls, rar, zip, exe, mp4, mkv (as video), and others.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
